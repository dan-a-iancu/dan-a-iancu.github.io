Dan Iancu is an Associate Professor of Operations, Information and Technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. A native of Romania, Prof. Iancu holds a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Yale University, an S.M. in Engineering Sciences from Harvard University, and a Ph.D. in Operations Research from MIT. Prior to joining Stanford, he spent one year as a Goldstine Fellow in the Risk Analytics Group at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. Prof. Iancu's research interests are in responsible analytics and AI and data-driven optimization, with applications in supply chain management, FinTech, and healthcare. His work is aimed both at improving existing methodological tools (e.g., by making them more robust, fair or transparent) and at applying these to design more effective, more equitable, and more sustainable solutions for complex operational problems. His research has been published in Management Science, Operations Research, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, and Mathematics of Operations Research. He is currently an Area Editor for Optimization in Operations Research and an Associate Editor (Optimization and Operations Management) in Management Science. He was the recipient of several best paper awards for his work in optimization as well as in operations and supply chains, and of teaching commendations at Harvard, MIT Sloan, and INSEAD.
